The answer to this question goes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a balance of many factors, including behavioural interpretability and explainability, computational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a growing body of research which attempts to compare the predictive performance of different ML classifiers with classical Random Utility Models (RUMs). However, existing studies typically analyse only the disaggregate predictive performance, ignoring other aspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many existing studies are affected by technical limitations, such as the use of inappropriate validation schemes, incorrect sampling for hierarchical data, a lack of external validation, and the exclusive use of discrete metrics. In this paper, we address these limitations by conducting a systematic comparison of different modelling approaches, across multiple modelling problems, in terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice (out-of-sample predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares, extraction of behavioural indicators, feature importance analysis, and computational efficiency). The modelling problems combine several real world datasets with synthetic datasets, where the data generation function is known. The results indicate that the models with the highest disaggregate predictive performance (namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forests (RF)) provide poorer estimates of behavioural indicators and aggregate mode shares, and are more expensive to estimate, than other models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Multinomial Logit (MNL). It is further observed that the MNL model performs robustly in a variety of situations, though ML techniques can improve the estimates of behavioural indices such as Willingness To Pay (WTP).","tags":null,"title":"A prediction and behavioural analysis of machine learning methods for modelling travel mode choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisca Rosell","Esteve Codina","Lídia Montero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663343668,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663343668,"objectID":"ea5d8711a2e4c1b8bd79e0ef039c0f57","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/publication/a-combined-and-robust-modal-split-traffic-assignment-model-for-rail-and-road-freight-transport/","publishdate":"2022-09-16T15:54:28.752Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-combined-and-robust-modal-split-traffic-assignment-model-for-rail-and-road-freight-transport/","section":"publication","summary":"Searching for achieving an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the EU has set as a goal a modal shift in freight transport of 30% by rail for the near future. In this context, it is vital to use modal choice models road versus rail to assess the shippers’ acceptance of the actions promoting the use of rail. This paper develops a combined model for jointly evaluating modal split and railway freight flows, addressed to the case when a modal split based on a random utility model is available, and some of its coefficients may present a non-negligible variability. To this end, after the initial deterministic formulation a robust counterpart of the model is developed. The model, formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem, is oriented to a multi-carrier environment and includes constraints to consider the interactions between the different types of flows on the railway network, allowing a good evaluation of the cost types of the carriers and the network capacity. An algorithmic solution based on the outer approximation method is shown to provide accurate solutions in a reasonable computational time for the robust and non-robust versions of the model. Examples centered on a section of the Trans-European Transport Network, the TEN-T Core network corridors, are reported to test the model’s applicability. Results show that this model can be a helpful tool for analyzing the possible shippers’ response to the different railway carriers’ services competing with the road.","tags":null,"title":"A combined and robust modal-split/traffic assignment model for rail and road freight transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Esteve Codina Sancho","Francisca Rosell Camps"],"categories":[],"content":"In October 2021, with the participation of the coordinators of the three subprojects, the Kick-off meeting was held in a virtual meeting.

The real-time railway traffic management problem deals with disruptions in railway networks, including tracks, junctions and stations. When they happen in station areas, new decisions involving train platforming, rerouting, ordering and timing must be made in real time. This paper explores a mesoscopic approach to deal with disruptions at rail stations. A mathematical programming-based model is proposed to determine re-routing and re-scheduling decisions for railway traffic in a station area. The key steps of the approach, which simulate what happens in real-time traffic management, are: i) an initial off-line preprocessing stage of the set of feasible routes originally planned, ii) a second preprocessing stage which analyses the disruption and sets the necessary parameters for the last step iii), which consists of an integer programming model that seeks solutions which minimise deviations from planned train schedules and assigns new and appropriate platforms (if necessary). Computational experiments show that realistic instances can be solved near to optimality using CPLEX in very short times. This allows to consider this methodology for solving real time traffic management problems.","tags":[],"title":"A Mixed-integer Linear Program for Real-time Train Platforming Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luís Cadarso","Esteve Codina","Ricardo García-Ródenas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647000705,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615673402,"objectID":"58bfd2f59f93b8e2174b0912b5ede8ed","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/publication/microscopic-disruption-management-energy-consumption-and-passenger-compensation-optimisation/","publishdate":"2021-03-13T22:09:53.496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/microscopic-disruption-management-energy-consumption-and-passenger-compensation-optimisation/","section":"publication","summary":"Rail operations are often disrupted by accidents that cause traffic to diverge from the scheduled operations, rendering it difficult to run the schedule as planned. In such a case, the operator must change the schedule to return to the original schedule. If passengers are delayed, a train operator may have a policy of economically compensating them (e.g., refunding ticket fare). Compensation amounts are usually determined by the length of the delay. As a result, it is critical to have a smart way of determining whether to accelerate trains to absorb delays, thus increasing energy usage, or to compensate passengers. This paper presents a mathematical model for determining the speed profile while taking passenger usage into account. The model determines the best sequence of operating regimes and switching points between them for a variety of different situations and train types, all while accounting for delays and passenger compensation policies. The aim is to reduce both the amount of energy consumed and the amount of compensation paid to passengers. There are constraints on traction and braking forces, train velocity, forces induced by vertical and horizontal track profile, and passenger compensation policy. The results of computational tests performed on practical problem instances of the Spanish rail operator RENFE are showed. The suggested approach is capable of producing strategies that strike an excellent balance between different managerial objectives.","tags":[],"title":"Microscopic Disruption Management: Energy Consumption and Passenger Compensation Optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Carlos García-García","Ricardo García-Ródenas","Julio Alberto López-Gómez","José Ángel Martín-Baos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646994969,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646994969,"objectID":"15fa87f4a98050203905f505c260989b","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/publication/a-comparative-study-of-machine-learning-deep-neural-networks-and-random-utility-maximization-models-for-travel-mode-choice-modelling/","publishdate":"2022-03-11T10:36:09.965Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-comparative-study-of-machine-learning-deep-neural-networks-and-random-utility-maximization-models-for-travel-mode-choice-modelling/","section":"publication","summary":"Traditionally, Random Utility Maximization (RUM) models have been widely applied to travel mode choice modelling.

The Dynamic OD Matrix Estimation (DODME) is a challenging problem since no direct observations are available, and therefore one should resort to indirect estimation approaches. Among the most efficient approaches, the one that formulates the problem in terms of a bi-level optimization problem has been widely used. This formulation solves at the upper level a nonlinear optimization problem that minimizes some distance measures between observed and estimated link flow counts at certain counting stations located in a subset of links in the network, and at the lower level a traffic assignment that estimates these link flow counts assigning the current estimated matrix. The variants of this formulation differ in the analytical approaches that estimate the link flows in terms of the traffic assignment and their time dependencies. Since these estimations are based on a traffic assignment at the lower level, these analytical approaches, although numerically efficient, imply a high computational cost. The advent of ICT applications has made available new sets of traffic-related measurements enabling new approaches; under certain conditions, the data collected allows to estimate the most likely used paths, from which a de facto assignment matrix can be computed. This allows extracting empirically similar information to that provided by the dynamic traffic assignment that is used in the analytical approaches. This paper explores how to extract such information from the recorded commercial data, proposes a new constrained non-linear optimization model to solve the DODME problem, with a reduced number of variables linearly depending on network size instead of quadratically. Moreover, the bilevel iterative process and the traffic assignment need are avoided. Validation and computational results on its performance are presented.","tags":[],"title":"Transport analytic approaches to the dynamic origin-destination estimation problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Ángel Martín-Baos","Ricardo García-Ródenas","Luis Rodriguez-Benitez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638957482,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638957482,"objectID":"e56c3a8a8a48e63f55afc0fe175f4cfc","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/publication/a-python-package-for-performing-penalized-maximum-likelihood-estimation-of-conditional-logit-models-using-kernel-logistic-regression/","publishdate":"2021-12-08T09:58:02.142Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-python-package-for-performing-penalized-maximum-likelihood-estimation-of-conditional-logit-models-using-kernel-logistic-regression/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last few years, the success of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has led to the extension of their applications to areas such as transport planning. One of the main tasks within transport planning is the analysis of transport demand. To do so, it is necessary to analyse the way in which users make their decisions about the trips they make and, therefore, be able to predict the number of passengers on the transport network in relation to respect to interventions made on the transport system. Consequently, transport policies and plans can be evaluated according to the behaviour of the passengers. Discrete choice models based on random utility maximization have been developed over the last four decades, becoming the canonical tool for transport demand analysis. Nowadays, the use of ML methods could provide an alternative to discrete choice models, as they reduce the need for the analyst to specify the functional expression of these models and achieve a higher level of accuracy in their predictions. A Python software package called PyKernelLogit was developed to apply a ML method called Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) to the problem of predicting the transport demand. This package allows the user to specify a set of models using KLR and the estimation of those using a Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure. Moreover, this tool also provides a set of indicators for goodness of fit and the application of model validation techniques. Finally, it allows to obtain the willingness to pay or value of time indicators commonly used in transport planning.","tags":null,"title":"A Python package for performing penalized maximum likelihood estimation of conditional logit models using Kernel Logistic Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xavier Ros-Roca","Lídia Montero","Jaume Barceló"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1636974296,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615673402,"objectID":"498d4d193acb9ce5f77b8475c980b6ca","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/publication/exploring-the-direct-and-indirect-use-of-ict-measurements-in-dodme-dynamic-od-matrix-estimation/","publishdate":"2021-03-13T22:09:53.496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/exploring-the-direct-and-indirect-use-of-ict-measurements-in-dodme-dynamic-od-matrix-estimation/","section":"publication","summary":"The estimation of the network traffic state, its likely short-term evolution, the prediction of the expected travel times in a network, and the role that mobility patterns play in transport modeling is usually based on dynamic traffic models, whose main input is a dynamic origin–destination (OD) matrix that describes the time dependencies of travel patterns; this is one of the reasons that have fostered large amounts of research on the topic of estimating OD matrices from the available traffic information. The complexity of the problem, its underdetermination, and the many alternatives that it offers are other reasons that make it an appealing research topic. The availability of new traffic data measurements that were prompted by the pervasive penetration of information and communications technology (ICT) applications offers new research opportunities. This study focused on GPS tracking data and explored two alternative modeling approaches regarding how to account for this new information to solve the dynamic origin–destination matrix estimation (DODME) problem, either including it as an additional term in the formulation model or using it in a data-driven modeling method to propose new model formulations.

For this purpose, a surrogate-based cooperative optimization framework is here proposed. Firstly, a class of parallel surrogate-based optimization algorithms is developed, based on the idea of viewing the infill sampling criterion as a bi-objective optimization problem. Each algorithm of this class is called a Sequential Multipoint Infill Sampling Algorithm (SMISA) and is the combination resulting from choosing a surrogate model, an exploitation measure, an exploration measure and a multi-objective optimization approach to its solution. SMISAs are the basic algorithms on which collaboration mechanisms are established. Many SMISAs can be defined, and the focus has been on scalar approaches for bi-objective problems such as the ε-constrained method, revisiting the Parallel Constrained Optimization using Response Surfaces (CORS-RBF) method and the Efficient Global Optimization with Pseudo Expected Improvement (EGO-PEI) algorithm as instances of SMISAs. In addition, a parallel version of the Lower Confidence Bound-based (LCB) algorithm is given as a member within the SMISA class. Secondly, we propose a cooperative optimization framework between the SMISAs. The cooperation between SMISAs occurs in two ways: (1) they share solutions and their objective function values to update their surrogate models and (2) they use the sampled points obtained from different SMISAs to guide their own search process. Some convergence results for this cooperative framework are given under weak conditions. A numerical comparison between EGO-PEI, Parallel CORS-RBF and a cooperative method using both, named CPEI, shows that CPEI improves the performance of the baseline algorithms. The numerical results were derived from 17 analytic tests and they show the reduction of wall-clock time with respect to the increase in the number of processors.","tags":[],"title":"A surrogate-based cooperative optimization framework for computationally expensive black-box problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisca Rosell","Esteve Codina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585738998,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615673402,"objectID":"44ce043c0d75ca26bba6db51e57eab41","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/publication/a-model-that-assesses-proposals-for-infrastructure-improvement-and-capacity-expansion-on-a-mixed-railway-network/","publishdate":"2021-03-13T22:09:53.496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-model-that-assesses-proposals-for-infrastructure-improvement-and-capacity-expansion-on-a-mixed-railway-network/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a mathematical programming-based model for evaluating the impact on a mixed railway network from proposals for infrastructure improvement and capacity expansion that are oriented mainly toward increasing freight transportation.

In this work, a mathematical programming model for the selection of candidate lines in extensions of the public transport system is proposed based on the linearization of the model presented by Codina et al. (2013) and its application to situations of medium congestion. The model assumes that the pool of candidate lines is an input externally determined by technical criteria and it is focused in the compatibility constraints that the final set of selected lines must verify. These constraints include the overall throughput capacity of the stops/stations of the model, the availability of space for users to wait at stations, the resulting line capacities for passenger flows at line segments and the waiting times of passengers at stops.

To this end, the proposed integrated model guarantees feasible timetables while balancing performance indexes for the interests of passengers and operators. Specified bounds are maintained for the differences between service planners optimal timetables and those that are operational at stations. The resulting problem is modeled as a multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. The model can be solved with sufficient accuracy and in a reasonable amount of computing time, as shown by tests on the Madrid-Zaragoza-Barcelona high speed railway network. In this case, we perform a Pareto frontier analysis and find that the problem is well-posed.

These spatially distributed systems are vulnerable to disruptions: during daily operations different incidents may occur. Despite the unpredictable nature of them, effective mitigation methods from an engineering perspective should be designed. In this paper, we present several risk averse measures for risk reduction in the rapid transit network design problem based on a set of finite scenarios to represent the disruptions’ uncertainty. As a counter-parts of the typical risk neutral strategy, some measures that are presented are aiming to minimizing the impacts of the worst scenario in the network operation, and another additionally, takes into account different risk reduction profiles. Some computational experience is presented.","tags":[],"title":"Rapid transit network design: considering recovery robustness and risk aversion measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://acosemsustran.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
